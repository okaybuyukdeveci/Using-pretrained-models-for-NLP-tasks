# Using-pretrained-models-for-NLP-tasks
* This application leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to perform a variety of text-based tasks. Users can input text and choose from several NLP tasks, including Sentiment Analysis, Text Generation, Translation, Summarization, and Named Entity Recognition (NER). The backend is powered by the Flask framework and utilizes pre-trained models from Hugging Face's transformers library to execute the chosen NLP task. The results are dynamically displayed on the webpage, providing real-time insights based on the user's input.

* Flask Framework: The app uses Flask to create a simple web server and handle routing, making it easy to interface with the front-end.
* Transformers Library: The app integrates multiple transformers pipelines to perform NLP tasks.
* User Interface: The HTML form allows users to enter text and select an NLP task. After submitting the form, the results are displayed dynamically based on the task selected.
* Responsive Design: The application is designed to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
